# Data-Representation-QueryProject
In this project I had to use React for Front-End and Express for Back-End. I choose to do basic
web-application with crud functionality which will allow the user to register/login and be able to add/edit/delete items and put them for sell 
once they've been proper authenticated.I've used Redux for state management, jwt which helped to implemnted the authentication using tokens, bcrypt
to encrypt the password  and so on you can check how the application looks like in the wiki section. Thank you.
